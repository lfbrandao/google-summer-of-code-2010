The Data Integration System is a set of two applications that can be used to connect and combine data from several databases. It comprises a central application that enables users to search for information on a configurable set of databases and a REST API that can be deployed on the databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) to enable read-only access to the data.

== Dependencies
The applications are configured to run on the version 2.5.5 of Ruby on Rails, and have the following dependencies:
* Central Application
	- to-do ...
* Data API
	- to-do ...

== Main Application
In the main application a user can search for information on a set of databases. The application has a web interface with a public area and an administration area. The web application contains the following groups of pages:
* Search - search for information in the directory of repositories
* Users - user management area
* Roles - roles management area
* Repositories - database management area
* Plugins - plugin management area

= Users and Roles
To distinguish users by what they are allowed to see and manage, three types of user groups or roles are defined:
1. Administrators - registered user. Can:
	* Search/query repositories
	* Users: view, assign roles, assign repositories, delete
	* Roles: view, create, delete, edit
	* Repositories: view, create, delete, edit
	* Plugins: view, create, delete, edit
2. Subscribers - registered user - Can:
	* Search/query repositories
3. Guests -  unregistered user - Can:
	* Search/query repositories

While all users have access to the search screen, the repositories that are queried on a search depend on the role of the user and on the permissions granted by the administrators. This association is made by role (each role has a set of repositories that its users can query) and by user (in addition to repositories defined in the user role, a user can have access to more repositories). Considering the following User A and Subscriber role:
* User A - has access to Repository1; belongs to the Role Subscriber
* Role Subscriber - has access to Repository2, Repository3
if the User A makes a search on the directory the repositories Repository1, Repository2 and Repository3 are queried.

The Guest role should be used to define a set of publicly queriable repositories. While the search screen will always be accessible to everyone, if the Guest role has no repositories assigned to it no repositories will queried.

By default, new registered users get the Subscriber role. Unregistered users have the Guest role assigned by default.

= Repositories
Repositories are searchable data sources are queried on a search made on the application.
